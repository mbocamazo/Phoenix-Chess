Mike and Dennis Design Review

______________________________________

Concrete things we want from Audience
_____________________________________
-How are you implementing quiescience search?
-What specific aspects of our current structures would you ML on?
-How do you plan on going about ML and is it applicable to our project?
_____________________________________
What we've done so far

-Gotten a incompletely implemented chess program
-Waded through non OBO code to get our AI integrated into the program
-begun implementation of tree search w/ basic board eval function
_____________________________________
 Lay out the plan

-quickly explain tree search
-implement alpha beta pruning
-implement quiescience search
-transposition tables??
-we want your opinion before we tell you how we currently plan to do ML
_____________________________________
What we're unsure of (open it to audience for response, QA format)

-what insights do you have on quiescience search?
-if you were going to go about ML on this structure, how would you do it?
	-what would you quantify on the board?
	-what would you weight and try to learn on?
-what's your personal plan of attack for ML and do you see it being applicable
to our project? 
_____________________________________
The original rest of our plan using ML

-use genetic algorithms to learn dynamic piece weights
-use genetic algorithms to learn on the quiescience search function
_____________________________________
Open it up to general comments, questions concerns.

Thanks for listening and thanks for the feedback!
