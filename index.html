        <p>This is the project page for Phoenix-Chess, a Chess AI written by Michael Bocamazo (<a href="https://github.com/mbocamazo" class="user-mention">@mbocamazo</a>) and Dennis Chen (<a href="https://github.com/dennis-chen" class="user-mention">@dennis-chen</a>) for Software Design Spring 2014, Olin College of Engineering.</p>

<p>Project Proposal:</p>

<p>The plan for Phoenix-Chess is to create a chess AI that can be refined and extended with machine learning techniques.  We will adopt the standard tree-search, minimaxing, alpha-beta pruning structure.  The non-trivial work will come in when constructing the board evaluation function and pruning heuristics based on volatility.  The board evaluation function will quantify material, activity of pieces, pawn value, pawn structure, board control, king safety, initiative, and a few features of the board state common to both players such as volatility, and an open/closed position.  Material, activity, and board control can have interrelated evaluations that dynamically weight the pieces.  The pruning function will eliminate branches that are judged to have a low probability of viability to speed tree search and thus allow for deeper evaluations.  We will also need to add a function to limit the search depth based on time available.  Once this groundwork has been laid, we can refine the weights of our board evaluation and pruning functions using machine learning, such as simple hill-climbing or possibly genetic algorithms with the extension of constructing new features.  We could also access master game databases and refine the weights to best approximate master level moves given a certain position.  If these tasks are done satisfactorily, we can try to add an opening book.  The greatest challenges we envision are the feature construction from primitive relationships between game elements, and interaction and analysis with game databases.</p>

<p>If we were to have an Angel Adviser, it would be best if they had experience with AI, chess, or ML.</p>

<p>Our proposed deliverables can be broken down as follows:</p>

<p>Minimum Deliverable: A chess board evaluation function/tree search shell that searches at least 4 total moves ahead when making itâ€™s choices. </p>

<p>Second Deliverable: Tree search pruning heuristic (suitable for machine learning)</p>

<p>Third Deliverable: Use ML to refine board weight function</p>

<p>Fourth Deliverable: Search and learn on databases of master level games to refine the board weight function</p>

<p>Fifth Deliverable: Use genetic algorithms to construct features within the board weight functions</p>

<p>Further extensions: iterate from deliverables 2 through 5 to improve the program.  Add an opening book.</p>

<p>The first step is to create an AI that does an exhaustive search at a certain depth with a basic board evaluation function.</p>

<p>This project will be done by Michael Bocamazo and Dennis Chen without collaboration from other groups.  The project repo is connected to this page at <a href="https://github.com/mbocamazo/Phoenix-Chess">https://github.com/mbocamazo/Phoenix-Chess</a>.</p>
